# Question-Answering-system
Question answering (QA) is a task that answers user's questions using a large collection of documents; it consists of two steps: (1) sort possible documents that contain the answer of a given question; and (2) extract the content from these documents and elaborate an answer to the user. In this notebook, we are going to explore techniques for identify the most similar document for a question, problem called _Document Retrieval_. We are going to experiment Document Retrieval in [Stanford Question Answering Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stanfordu/stanford-question-answering-dataset). In the end, I hope you are going to be able to apply some algorithms to handle with this problem.
